<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](images/rudo-screeshot.png)

**Rudo** (from **Rust** + **todo**) is an attempt of transformimg developers' primary tool, terminal, to a feature
reach application. When starting that project, I was challenged to create UX experience which can be compared
to the one we are used to on the web. On the other hand, as a fan of geeky things I was looking for a simple
terminal utility, that I can use to manage simple to-do lists.

### Built With
